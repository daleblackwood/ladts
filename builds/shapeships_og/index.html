			<h4>LAD.js demo by Dale J Williams</h4>
			<p>Fly your paper-plane-typed ship for as long as possible, fighting off wave after wave of gradually improving enemies. Become the master of some kind of <i>space paper</i> environment.</p>
			<div id="instructions">
				<h3>Controls</h3>
				<table class="controls">
					<tr><td>Move Ship</td><td>W, A, S, D</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Shoot</td><td>Arrow Keys, Space or Mouse</td></tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>This game runs from my engine LAD.js, is a Javascript/Canvas game, made in about twenty hours. Interesting tech includes:
				<ul>
					<li>A path-drawing framework, resembling that of graphics software.</li>
					<li>Seperated game logic and rendering loops - allowing for maximum framerate whilst maintaining play speed.</li>
					<li>A full engine backend - to be extended.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>I've put this game, and engine LAD.js, on Google Code under a BSD license - so have at it, if you will, just remember to keep the attribution and note your changes.</p>
